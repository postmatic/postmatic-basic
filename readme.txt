The new standard in comment subscriptions for WordPress. Two-way email commenting which is intelligent, responsive, and convenient.

== Description ==

Take *Subscribe to Comments*. Now, make it smart. And beautiful. And a good listener that accepts replies. That's Replyable, and it's built by Postmatic.

= Comment subscriptions reimagined - for better SEO, better conversations, and easier comment management =

**Replyable is smart**: Not all comments are created equal. Some are thoughtful, relevant, and worth sharing. Others are just a waste of time. Replyable lets your users subscribe to comments without fear - machine learning rates comments for relevance and only sends the best to subscribers.

**Replyable is aware**: Nobody will get too much email. As conversations get busy comments will be combined into a daily digest. *Subscribe to comments* is finally safe again. Or, let your users subscribe to only direct replies to their comments.

**Replyable listens**: Reply to any email sent from Replyable to post your response as a followup comment. No forms, no websites. It works online or offline, from anywhere. And to make comment moderation easier, authors can moderate comments with simple email commands.

**Replyable plays wells with others**: Replyable is compatible with all other WordPress comment plugins including Epoch, wpDiscuz, Inline Comments, Commentluv, and your current antispam and moderation workflows.

The days of one-way notifications are over. It’s time to let them hit reply.

= Core Features =

* Subscribe to Comments modernized - rock-solid comment subscriptions which comply with *all international spam laws*.
* Single-click migration from legacy *Subscribe to Comments* plugins.
* Comment subscriptions reimagined - Our notifications bring along profile images, gravatars, post recaps, and display the comment in context of the larger conversation.
* Responsive templates - rich html-based comment templates that look great on both desktop and mobile displays.
* Fully branded, auto-adapting templates which magically mimic your active theme - it's true. Our email templates self-adjust to match the colors, images, and typography of your theme. It's kind of nuts.
* Replyable strictly adheres to WordPress best practices. It uses the native commenting and user systems. We’re just a magical email gateway.
* Users can subscribe to all comments on a post, or choose to just receive direct replies to their own comments.
* Automatic pausing of subscriptions on chatty posts - if too many comments are happening at once subscriptions will automatically be placed on pause the users notified. They can resume their subscription with a simple command. 

= Premium Features (starting at $2.99/month, 30 day free trial) =

* Reply to comments without leaving your inbox - reply to any comment notification to post a followup comment. Even when offline.
* Automatic author subscriptions - Choose to have authors and guest authors automatically subscribed to comments on their own posts. Replyable will deliver the most relevant and thoughtful comments via email (no *nice post, dude* notices here), and of course let them reply to send a response.
* Moderation as a shared task - Authors can also moderate comments with simple email commands such as approve, spam, or trash. Or, just reply with a response and the comment will be approved and the reply posts, all without touching WordPress.
* Comment Intelligence - Replyable recognizes the quality and relevance of comments and only sends the best to people who have subscribed. Comment content is scored for relevance, length, reading level, and sentiment. If it doesn’t add to the conversation, it’ll be held back and only included in a daily recap.
* Subscription scaling for any size community - Email is great – but too much of it can be a drag. Replyable throttles notifications on chatty posts to meet the needs of the conversation. When things are quiet subscribers receive new comments as they happen. If there are more than a few new comments in the same day email is held back and grouped together into a what’s new daily digest. Best of all, direct replies are always sent immediately to keep side conversations going without bothering the larger group.
* Outbound email delivery - stop worrying about host throttling, spam filters, and deliverability. All Replyable notices are sent via our servers and include guaranteed delivery.
* Affordable plans for any site.


We’re serious about privacy and doing the right thing. We do not profile users, run ads, or sell data in any way and maintain a very strict [privacy](http://replyable.email/privacy) policy.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Postmatic and Replyable? Which is right for me? =
Think of Replyable as Postmatic's over-achieving little sister. Same tech, same people, just smaller and, well, more focused. We took the most-loved features from Postmatic, refined them, and then dropped the price by 85%. Hooray!

Replyable brings all of the *commenting* features from Postmatic. No delivery of posts, automatic digests, or newsletters. No optin forms. No webhooks, integrations, or otherwise. Just perfect comment subscriptions for instant gains in SEO, engagement, and  conversations.

= I already use the paid version Postmatic. Can I switch to Replyable? =
The choice is yours. If you already use Postmatic and want to stick with it you can. It contains everything you'll find in Replyable, in addition to optins, content delivery, newsletters, digests, webhooks, and more. If none of that stuff matters to you just cancel your Postmatic service, disable the plugin, and enable Replyable instead. Your previous Postmatic comment subscriptions will work without a hitch.

= I used to use the free version of Postmatic (Postmatic Basic). Where did it go and what should I do? =
Postmatic Basic has been replaced by Replyable. It's safe to switch to Replyable - your previous Postmatic subscriptions will work just fine. To learn more about what has changed [visit our support site](http://replyable.helpscoutdocs.com/article/263-im-a-postmatic-basic-user-whats-different-about-replyable).

= I already use Subscribe to Comments/Reloaded. Can I switch to Replyable? =

Totally. Upon activation you'll be invited to migrate your Subscribe to Comments subscriptions in just one click.

= This is really free? Do you sell my data or run advertising? =

Yes to free. [No to bad stuff](http://replyable.email/privacy). We're not in the data brokering or advertising game. Instead we're in the business of making [Replyable](http://replyable.email/features) _so good_ and _so affordable_ that you'll happily upgrade.You can help fund our development while sending your engagement through the roof by subscribing to one of our extremely affordable plans. They start at just $2.99 a month!

= Is this a 3rd party commenting system? =
Not at all. Replyable uses native WordPress commenting. All we do is wire up some magic to turn emails into comments, then push them to your site via the WordPress api. We even have a companion plugin, [Epoch](http://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch) which will serve as a replacement for Disqus if you need to move back to native commenting.

= How quickly do email comments post to my website =
It takes Replyable **six to ten seconds** after you hit send to turn your email into a WordPress comment.


== Screenshots ==
1. Replyable installs in seconds with zero configuration (you can play with settings if you want to, though). The only thing you'll notice is a little checkbox on your comment form.
2. This is what Subscribe to Comments looks like. It could use a facelift. Scroll down to see the same comment notification sent by Replyable.
3. Comment notifications for the modern day! Our templates are fully branded (your brand, not ours), adjust automatically to match your brand typography and colors, and frankly are just awesome. Notifications include gravatars, post recaps, and conversational context with inline reply buttons for each comment. Whoa.
4. A comment moderation email. Post authors are automatically subscribed to moderate comments on their own writing. From here the author can approve/spam/trash, or both approve and reply at once with a simple email reply. All without touching WordPress.
5. Replyable makes sure nobody gets too much email. Subscribers to busy posts will recieve a daily recap of only the best comments and can jump into the conversation from any place.

- NEW: Choose to automatically subscribe authors to comments on their own posts (Daily Discourse and above)

This can be activated from the settings > replyable > configure comments screen.
- NEW: Replies-only + Daily Digest mode. This has the effect of sending direct comment replies only in addition to daily comment summaries to subscribed users. You can be activated by setting Flood Control to 1. [See our blog](https://gopostmatic.com/2017/05/2-1/) for more info.
- NEW: Inbox previews in Gmail and most desktop email clients. Subscribers can now see your sitename, post title, and excerpt all from their inbox, before opening an emailed post. Comment subscribers can see the first few lines of the new comment. [See our blog](https://gopostmatic.com/2017/05/2-1/) for more info.
