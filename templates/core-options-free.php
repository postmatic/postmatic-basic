		simple, elegant manner on any device—all while taking advantage of client-specific functionality.</p>

	<p>Not only does Postmatic Premium put your newly published posts in to rich html templates, but it does the same
		for comment notifications as well.<br/>

		Like magic, we bring the comment stream directly to your reader’s inbox with support for gravatars, post recaps
		and intelligent threaded commenting context. Comments get delivered in a way that makes the whole picture
		clearer. Which gives your reader more understanding and creates much better conversations.</p>

	<h2>Outgoing mail delivery using Mailchimp and Rackspace</h2>

	<p>Regardless of your web host and their ideas about email throttling, you can be sure posts and comments will get
		to where they’re going, as quickly as possible. We use the same infrastructure as Mailchimp and Rackspace to
		send with the highest deliverability rates in the industry. Fifty thousand subscribers? No problem.</p>

	<h2>Moderate new comments by email</h2>

	<p>WordPress notifications are, well, just notifications. We can do better than that. Postmatic Premium lets you
		moderate comments by email with a simple word. Just reply with <em>approve</em>, <em>trash</em> or <em>spam</em>
		and we’ll take care of the rest.</p>
