		<h1><?php _e( 'Welcome!', 'Postmatic' ); ?></h1>
		<h2>Thanks again for beta testing Postmatic.</h2>
		<p>We've created a special plan for beta testers which will allow you to keep using all of the features you've come to know. For free. It's our way of saying thanks.</p>
		<p>The plan is already active on this blog. Use it for however long you want.</p>
		<h3>But what are you missing?</h3>
		<p>We are adding features to Postmatic all the time. You are welcome to stay on your current free-forever plan and benefit from outgoing mail delivery, full html templates, throttling, invitations, and email commenting - everything that was available up to version 1.0.</p>
		<p>If you would like to try out some of the new features as we move foward you'll need to upgrade. Already in 1.0 that means gaining access to email-based comment moderation. Soon we'll roll out digests and following that a new template library and support for custom post types.</p>
		<p>To learn about what you might be missing you can always visit <a href="http://gopostmatic.com/premium">our site</a>.</p>
		<h2>Want to upgrade and support our work?</h2>
		<p>That would be fantastic. If you've enjoyed Postmatic and want to show your love please do consider upgrding to the Startup plan. You can find out how by <a href="http://app.gopostmatic.com">visiting your dashboard</a>.</p>
		<p>Thanks for all your help,</p>
